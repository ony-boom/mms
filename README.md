# MMS - My Music Server

![Demo](./apps/client/assets/banner.png)

## Overview

MMS is a web-based local music player that allows you to manage and play your music collection from your browser.

**Status**: Work in progress, but fully functional for basic music playback.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MMS is designed for **local use only** and is not intended for deployment on public-facing servers. The client application works well, but the server component is not optimized for production environments, lacks user management capabilities, and doesn't include the security hardening required for public internet exposure.

## Installation

### Nix/home-manager users

You can use the home-manager module in this repo to install:

```nix
# in your flake input
{
    inputs = {
        mms = {
            url = "github:ony-boom/mms";
            inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
       };
    };
}

# then somewhere in your config:
{
     services.mms = {
        enable = true;
        # see /nix/modules/home-manager.nix for the other options
    };
}
```

And optional but useful, add this to your flake or any method you prefer for extra subtituters, this way you avoid re-building the package:

```nix
  nixConfig = {
    extra-substituters = [
      "https://ony-boom.cachix.org"
    ];
    extra-trusted-public-keys = [
      "ony-boom.cachix.org-1:rPOTyyOCiAhLarertCrNnZLxsBFpcirEekoohcCZt10="
    ];
  };

```

> [!NOTE]
> For other installation methods, I haven't done anything with them yet.

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ony-boom/mms.git
   cd mms
   ```

2. Install dependencies (requires Node.js â‰¥ 20 and pnpm):
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up the project:
   ```sh
   pnpm run setup
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```

- [Client Documentation](./apps/client/README.md)
- [Server Documentation](./apps/server/README.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The client should support using other servers, but the server is only compatible with the client.
> If you want to use the client with another server, you can implement the same API as the server.
> See `apps/client/src/clients/rest` for an example.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Maybe switch to a desktop application framework (Tauri or Wails are preferred over Electron)
- [ ] Add more advanced music library management features
- [ ] Implement user management and authentication for multi-user scenarios
- [ ] Optimize server performance for larger music libraries
